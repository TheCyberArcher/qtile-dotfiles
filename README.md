>This repository contains the list of my configurations for the windows tilling manager called qtile. The code is written in Python since the software is coded exclusively in this language. This is my first RICE on a WM of this type (as a reminder, I have no skills in graphic design and UI), but having done the best I can, this one brings me total satisfaction for my productivity.

### requirements :

- [psutils](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [qtile](https://qtile.org/)
- [qtile-extras](https://qtile-extras.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
- [cava](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cava)
  
<br />

>A bash script is present to launch the necessary configurations and software when my Archlinux  start
